   Simple reliable sliding window protocol.

   There are two kinds of packets, Data packets and Ack-only packets.
   You can tell the type of a packet by length.  Ack packets are 8
   bytes, while Data packets vary from 12 to 500 bytes.

   Every Data packet contains a 32-bit sequence number as well as 0 or
   more bytes of payload.

   Both Data and Ack packets contain the following fields.  The
   length, seqno, and ackno fields are always in big-endian order.

   - cksum: 16-bit IP checksum (you can set the cksum field to 0 and
            use the cksum() on a packet to compute the value of the
            checksum that should be in there).

   - len:   16-bit total length of the packet.  This will be 8 for Ack
            packets, and 12 + payload-size for data packets (since 12
            bytes are used for the header).

	    An end-of-file condition is transmitted to the other side
            of a connection by a data packet containing 0 bytes of
            payload, and hence a len of 12.

	    Note: You must examine the length field, and should not
            assume that the UDP packet you receive is the correct
            length.  The network might truncate or pad packets.

   - ackno: 32-bit cumulative acknowledgement number.  This says that
            the sender of a packet has received all packets with
            sequence numbers earlier than ackno, and is waiting for
            the packet with a seqno of ackno.

            Note that the ackno is the sequence number you are waiting
            for, that you have not received yet.  The first sequence
            number in any connection is 1, so if you have not received
            any packets yet, you should set the ackno field to 1.

   The following fields only exist in a data packet:

   - seqno: Each packet transmitted in a stream of data must me
            numbered with a seqno.  The first packet in a stream has
            seqno 1.  Note that in TCP, sequence numbers indicate
            bytes, whereas by contrast this protocol just numbers
            packets.  That means that once a packet is transmitted, it
            cannot be merged with another packet for retransmission.

   - data:  Contains (len - 12) bytes of payload data for the
            application.

   To conserve packets, a sender should not send more than one
   unacknowledged Data frame with less than the maximum number of
   packets (500), somewhat like TCP's Nagle algorithm.

   Important notes about the library:

   * A connection is named by the tuple:

     <local-IP-address, local-UDP-port, remote-IP-address, remote-UDP-port>

     In stand-alone mode, and in the client, the task of connection
     demultiplexing is handled automatically for you.  In server
     mode, you must demultiplex packets yourself.  A useful function
     for this is addreq(), which compares two sockaddr_storage
     structures and tells you if they are the same.

   * The configuration of the program is described by a structure
     config_common that gets passed to various functions.  The most
     important fields are:

       - window:  Tells you the size of the sliding window (which will
                  be 1 for stop-and-wait).

       - timeout: Tells you what your retransmission timer should be,
                  in milliseconds.  If after this many milliseconds a
                  packet you sent has still not been acknowledged, you
                  must retransmit the packet.  You may find the
                  function clock_gettime with parameter
                  CLOCK_MONOTONIC useful for keeping track of when
                  packets are sent.  Run "man clock_gettime".

   * Your task is to implement the following six functions:

       rel_create, rel_destroy, rel_recvpkt,
       rel_read, rel_output, rel_timer

     as well to augment the reliable_state data structure.  All the
     changes you need to make are in the file reliable.c.

   * The reliable_state structure encapsulates the state of each
     connection.  The structure is typedefed to rel_t in this file,
     but the contents of the reliable_state structure is defined in
     reliable.c, where you should add more fields as needed to keep
     your per-connection state.

   * A rel_t is created by the rel_create function.  The library will call
     rel_create directly for you.

   * A rel_t is deallocated by rel_destroy().  The library will call
     rel_destroy when it receives an ICMP port unreachable (signifying
     that the other end of the connection has died).  You should also
     call rel_destroy when all of the following hold:

       - You have read an EOF from the other side (i.e., a Data packet
         of len 12, where the payload field is 0 bytes).

       - You have read an EOF or error from your input (conn_input
         returned -1).

       - All package you have sent have been acknowledged.

     Note that to be correct, at least one side should also wait
     around in case the last ack it sent got lost, the way TCP uses
     the FIN_WAIT state, but this is not required.

   * When a packet is received, the library will call either
     rel_recvpkt.  The library already knows what rel_t to use for the
     particular UDP port receiving the packet, and supplies you with the rel_t.

   * To get the input data that you must send in your packets, call
     conn_input.  If no data is available, conn_input will return 0.
     At that point, the library will call rel_read once data is again
     available to from conn_input.

   * To output data you have received in decoded UDP packets, call
     conn_output.  The function conn_bufspace tells you how much space
     is available.  If you try to write more than this, conn_output
     may return that it has accepted fewer bytes than you have asked
     for.  You should flow control the sender by not acknowledging
     packets if there is no buffer space available for conn_output.
     The library calls rel_output when output has drained, at which
     point you can send out more Acks to get more data from the remote
     side.

   * The function rel_timer is called periodically, currently at a
     rate 1/5 of the retransmission interval.  You can use this timer
     to inspect packets and retransmit packets that have not been
     acknowledged.  Do not retransmit every packet every time the
     timer is fired!  You must keep track of which packets need to be
     retransmitted when.
